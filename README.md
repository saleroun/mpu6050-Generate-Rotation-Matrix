# imu-Generate-Rotation-Matrix

This file help you to set up your mpu in every angle you want after that based on gravity (z) find right angle, and show you the right coordinate
both header files, you can find in the https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib
this matrix catches raw data from the initial mpu situation, after calculation run final-data().
this matrix not only support mpu6050 but after some changes you can use in other types of imu.
