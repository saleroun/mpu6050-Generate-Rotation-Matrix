# IMU Rotation Matrix Creation
The IMU Rotation Matrix Creation is a library that helps align your sensor with the inertial reference frame to interpret the data accurately. This library provides rotation matrices, which are populated with trigonometric functions or quaternions, to perform the necessary rotations.
Installation
To use this library, you need to include the header files from the I2Cdevlib repository. Make sure to download and include them in your project.
# Usage
Calibrate the sensor: Before using the IMU, it is essential to calibrate it according to the manufacturer's datasheet. This step ensures accurate measurements and can sometimes involve using an external EEPROM for calibration.
Initialize the IMU: Set up the IMU sensor and configure it according to your specific hardware requirements.
Populate the rotation matrix: Use the provided functions to populate the rotation matrix with raw data from the initial MPU situation. If you are using a different type of IMU, you may need to make some modifications to the code.
Run the final-data() function: After populating the rotation matrix, run the final-data() function to process the data and make it ready for interpretation.
# Rotation Matrices
Moving a vector in three-dimensional space can be complex. One common technique involves sequential rotations around fixed axes using rotation matrices. A rotation matrix is a 3x3 matrix that contains all the necessary information to move a vector in a single rotation without using trigonometry.
By using rotation matrices, you can reorient vectors in a single rotation, such as yaw, pitch, and roll. Each rotation requires a specific orientation of axes for proper function. It is important to note that when a single movement can be described by multiple rotations, gimbal-lock is possible.
Quaternions are also a preferred option as they require less computation by the MCU. They offer a faster and simpler way to rotate a three-dimensional vector around a fixed axis, using basic calculations of addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication.
